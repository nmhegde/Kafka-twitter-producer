# Kafka-twitter-producer

This script can be used to stream twitter data to a Kafka broker service.
Also, the twitter api allows filters for specific words.

So, the script has this option to filter the specific words which are present in the filter.csv file.
Use the OAuth credentials given by twitter before you run the producer


To run this producer:
```
python kafka_producer.py
```
